      <h2>
        These are Nikola Tesla’S 10 major contributions and accomplishments
      </h2>
      <div id="list">
        <ul>
          <li>
            He patented the polyphase alternating current induction motor in
            1887-88. Based on the principal of rotating magnetic fields, his
            first induction motor generated ¼ horse power at 1800 revolutions
            per minute and weighed only 20 pounds, which was a fantastic
            achievement at the time.
          </li>
          <li>
            His alternating current emerged winner in the battle of currents.
            The ac current voltage could be stepped up and down and this meant
            that it was easier and cheaper to transmit it over long distances.
          </li>
          <li>
            He developed Tesla turbine as an alternative engine for mechanical
            machines. Also referred to as a bladeless turbine, the Tesla Turbine
            used the boundary layer effect, and not a fluid impinging upon the
            blades as in a conventional turbine.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was instrumental in building one of the first hydroelectric
            plants. The World’s Columbian Exposition was a world fair held at
            Chicago in 1893. It was built over 686 acres containing many
            separate buildings.
          </li>
          <li>
            He invented the Tesla coil leading to the posibility of wireless
            transmission. Further exploring the work of Heinrich Hertz on
            electromagnetic radiations and radio waves, Tesla tried powering a
            Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator.
          </li>
          <li>
            He invented an electro-mechanical oscillator. In 1893, Nikola Tesla
            patented a steam-powered electric generator known as Tesla’s
            electro-mechanical oscillator. Tesla’s oscillator is a reciprocating
            electricity generator.
          </li>
          <li>
            He made important contributions in radio technology. In 1897, Tesla
            submitted his patent for a multi circuit radio device which was
            awarded in 1900 in the United States. This led to the rejection of
            Marconi’s patent in the US in 1900.
          </li>
          <li>
            He created one of the world's first wireless remote controls. In the
            first known example of the use of remote control Tesla would control
            a boat from afar using radio waves technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            He played a key role in the development of X rays. Tesla correctly
            realized that strong shadows could be produced only at great
            object-film distances and with short exposure times; and that thick
            walls produced rays with greater penetrating power. He was also the
            first to comment on the biological hazards of X rays. He took an
            X-ray or shadowgraph of a foot with a shoe on it and sent it with a
            congratulatory letter to Roentgen.
          </li>
          <li>
            He had close to 300 patents. He did not patent some of his
            innovations and some have laid hidden in the patent archives. There
            are at least 278 patents which are known to have been issued to
            Tesla in 26 countries, majorly United States, Britain and Canada.
